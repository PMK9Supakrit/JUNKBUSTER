            <div class="descript">
                <p>Currently, our planet is surrounded by space debris. They are pieces of junk orbiting Earth left by human activities. It can refer to big objects such as dead satellites that have failed or been left in orbit at the end of their mission. It can also refer to smaller things, like bits of debris or paint flecks that have fallen off a rocket.</p><br>
                <p>We may not be able to see space debris on our telescopes, but they are everywhere. According to the Natural History Museum, there are 3,000 dead satellites in Earth's orbit, 34,000 pieces of space junk larger than 10 centimeters, and 128 million pieces of space junk larger than 1 millimeter. Since these pieces of debris move at around 18000mph, even something tiny has the power to penetrate through spacecraft-grade metal. Right now, the satellites that make up our global infrastructure are being put directly in the line of fire.</p><br>
                <p>If we don’t do anything about it, this problem will spiral out of control. As more and more space debris end up in our orbit, the risk of a collision increases exponentially. In the worst-case scenario, it might get to the point where it becomes impossible to send anything up into space since there is so much debris. If we do not do anything about it, the debris may form a deadly barrier, forever trapping humanity on Earth.</p>

        <p class="p2">At the moment, our satellites are being put directly in the line of fire. These satellites make up our global infrastructure, performing essential tasks like communication, collecting weather data, navigation, and more. The most shocking fact is that a collision with a single pea-sized piece of debris can easily destroy one of these satellites. This is mostly due to the extreme speed of the debris in Earth’s orbit. They can move at 18000mph so even a small piece packs some serious punch.</p>
        <p class="p3">If we don’t do anything about it, this problem will spiral out of control. As more and more space debris end up in our orbit, the risk of a collision increases exponentially.

    <div class="text_box">Our plan to solve this problem is to send a spacecraft up into orbit to clean up the space junk before it becomes a bigger problem.</div>

            <div class="descript">Propulsion will be provided by ion thrusters, which works by accelerating ions with electricity to create thrust. It is advantageous because it does not require liquid fuel, and can simply be powered by a solar cell. This means that it will last longer since it does not need to be refueled.</div>

            <div class="descript">To detect the debris, we can use a combination of cameras. They must be accurate enough to see things that are less than a millimeter in diameter from a distance. We can also detect debris from ground-based stations. Because of this, we can prioritize what we want to clean up first for maximum efficiency.</div>

            <div class="descript">In order to capture and clean up the space junk, we can use a variety of tools. The small and tiny debris can be vaporized or pushed away with a high-powered laser. Larger ones can be captured with a strong carbon-fiber net and stored in the spacecraft to be compressed. The compressed junk can either be ejected down to earth to be burned up in the atmosphere, or be recycled into extra resources for emergency repairs.</div>
