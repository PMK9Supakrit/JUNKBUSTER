    <div class="problem">
        <p>Currently, our planet is surrounded by space debris. They are pieces of junk orbiting Earth left by human activities. It can refer to big objects such as dead satellites that have failed or been left in orbit at the end of their mission. It can also refer to smaller things, like bits of debris or paint flecks that have fallen off a rocket.</p>

        <p style="margin-bottom: 30px">At the moment, our satellites are being put directly in the line of fire. These satellites make up our global infrastructure, performing essential tasks like communication, collecting weather data, navigation, and more. The most shocking fact is that a collision with a single pea-sized piece of debris can easily destroy one of these satellites. This is mostly due to the extreme speed of the debris in Earth’s orbit. They can move at 18000mph so even a small piece packs some serious punch.</p>
        <p>If we don’t do anything about it, this problem will spiral out of control. As more and more space debris end up in our orbit, the risk of a collision increases exponentially. In the worst-case scenario, it might get to the point where it becomes impossible to send anything up into space since there is so much debris. If we do not do anything about it, the debris may form a deadly barrier, forever trapping humanity on Earth.</p>

    <div class="text_box">Our plan to solve this problem is to send a spacecraft up into orbit to clean up the space junk before it becomes a bigger problem.</div>
