    <div class="problem">
        <p>Currently, our planet is surrounded by space debris. They are pieces of junk orbiting Earth left by human activities. It can refer to big objects such as dead satellites that have failed or been left in orbit at the end of their mission. It can also refer to smaller things, like bits of debris or paint flecks that have fallen off a rocket.</p>

        </div>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 30px">At the moment, our satellites are being put directly in the line of fire. These satellites make up our global infrastructure, performing essential tasks like communication, collecting weather data, navigation, and more. The most shocking fact is that a collision with a single pea-sized piece of debris can easily destroy one of these satellites. This is mostly due to the extreme speed of the debris in Earth’s orbit. They can move at 18000mph so even a small piece packs some serious punch.</p>
        <p>If we don’t do anything about it, this problem will spiral out of control. As more and more space debris end up in our orbit, the risk of a collision increases exponentially. In the worst-case scenario, it might get to the point where it becomes impossible to send anything up into space since there is so much debris. If we do not do anything about it, the debris may form a deadly barrier, forever trapping humanity on Earth.</p>

    <div class="text_box">Our plan to solve this problem is to send a spacecraft up into orbit to clean up the space junk before it becomes a bigger problem.</div>

        <div class="descript">We aimed to create a web-app video game that helps convey our messages and raise awareness for the rising concerns over the space debris pollution. The video game well represents our solution to help manage the overwhelming numbers of debris in the Earth’s orbit by using our Junk Buster Space ship to collect the debris that could still be re-used as spare parts for other future space-missions, and destroy the small pieces of debris that are harmful and could not be re-cycled anymore.</div><br>
        <div class="descript">Our team has the best intention to create a fascinating video game which would draw a large public attention to come and play our educational game of space debris.</div><br>
        <div class="descript">We started the project by creating a 3D model of the Junk buster spaceship with a program called Solid Works, then we embedded the spaceship 3D model into another software program called Unity to develop the game coding and mechanics.</div>

        <div class="descript">Propulsion will be provided by ion thrusters, which works by accelerating ions with electricity to create thrust. It is advantageous because it does not require liquid fuel, and can simply be powered by a solar cell. This means that it will last longer since it does not need to be refueled.</div>

        <div class="descript">To detect the debris, we can use a combination of cameras. They must be accurate enough to see things that are less than a millimeter in diameter from a distance. We can also detect debris from ground-based stations. Because of this, we can prioritize what we want to clean up first for maximum efficiency.</div>

        <div class="descript">In order to capture and clean up the space junk, we can use a variety of tools. The small and tiny debris can be vaporized or pushed away with a high-powered laser. Larger ones can be captured with a strong carbon-fiber net and stored in the spacecraft to be compressed. The compressed junk can either be ejected down to earth to be burned up in the atmosphere, or be recycled into extra resources for emergency repairs.</div>
